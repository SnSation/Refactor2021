Refactor 2021
=============

**Author**: Alexander Blair | ablairdevelopment@gmail.com

**Last Update**: 03/02/2021

Refactor 2021 is a project to Refactor, Document, & Comment projects I had done in 2020.
It is a second look at previous work to see what could be improved.
The goal of Refactor 2021 is to rewite all major projects written during my time with the Coding Temple software development & data analysis bootcamp.

About
-------------------------

While I looking to break into the software development industry, eventually I was asked for coding samples and a portfolio.
GitHub is where I keep most of my work, so the obvious answer is to send people there.
As soon as I sent the link, a wave of anxiety hit me.
My repositories are an absolute mess!
The projects are named in a way that only makes sense to me, the beginner code is essentially illegible by human eyes (most computers too), comments are few and far between (if at all present), and there is literally 0 documentation.

Refactor 2021 is an attempt to make this a portfolio that someone can understand.
Now that class is over, the real work begins!

Features
------------

**Core:**
- Rename: A project's name should give an idea of what it is
- Document: A project's README should give a surface level understanding of how it works
- Comment: A project's code should be commented such that a human, other than yourself, can follow what it is doing
- Refactor: A project isn't complete when the goals have been reached. New knowledge, techniques, & ideas should be implemented to improve it.

**Secondary:**
- Extended Documentation: Complex & Interactive projects may require more than just a README to explain how they work
- Portfolio Website: In tandem with Refactor 2021, a portfolio website will be created to showcase the projects
